# Services Section Update - Walkthrough

## What Changed

Rewrote the **Services section** on your portfolio website to focus on **hands-on technical skills** instead of high-level strategy, making it more suitable for **SDET-1 positions targeting 12 LPA**.

## Why This Matters

The previous services section emphasized strategic planning skills like "Test Automation Strategy" and "Quality Process Improvement" - things expected from senior SDETs or QA leads. For SDET-1 roles, hiring managers want to see **concrete technical abilities** you can contribute on day one.

## Changes Made

### Before → After

| Old Service (Strategic) | New Service (Technical) |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| ❌ Test Automation Strategy | ✅ API Testing & Validation |
| ❌ API Testing & Validation (generic) | ✅ Test Framework Development |
| ❌ CI/CD Integration (generic) | ✅ Web Automation (Selenium/Playwright) |
| ❌ Quality Process Improvement | ✅ CI/CD Integration (specific tools) |
| ❌ Test Framework Development (generic) | ✅ Test Case Design & Execution |
| ❌ Manual Testing Excellence | ✅ Defect Management & Reporting |
