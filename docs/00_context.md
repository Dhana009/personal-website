# 00 - Project Context

**Document Purpose:** Provides complete background - who, what, why, when, where

## WHO

### About You
- **Name:** Dhanunjaya
- **Current Role:** QA Automation Engineer (SDET-1) at SproutsAI
- **Experience:** 
  - Aug 2023 - Mar 2024: Manual Tester at SproutsAI
  - Apr 2024 - Present: QA Automation Engineer (SDET-1) at SproutsAI
- **Background:** B.Tech in Aeronautical Engineering (non-traditional path to QA)
- **Skills:** Manual testing foundation → transitioning to automation
- **Actual Automation Experience:** 8+ months

### Current Situation
- **Status:** Received 1-month notice period
- **Timeline:** 30 days to prepare and secure new position
- **Available Time:** 12-15 focused hours per day
- **No other commitments:** 100% focus on preparation

---

## WHAT

### The Goal
Build a production-grade test automation framework that demonstrates **senior-level architectural thinking** to secure a **12 LPA SDET position**.

### Why Framework (Not Just Practice Tests)
Portfolio/framework is the **differentiator** when:
- You might not nail live coding perfectly
- Technical knowledge is developing
- Need to show **problem-solving mindset** over implementation skill

### The Application: Flow Hub
- **What:** SaaS web application for testing demonstration
- **URL:** https://testing-box.vercel.app/login
- **Features:**
  - Login/logout flow
  - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete items)
  - Activity log (audit trail)
  - Search functionality
  - **3 User Roles:** Admin (full access), Editor (create/edit), Viewer (read-only)

**Why Flow Hub is Perfect:**
- Multi-role application (real-world SaaS scenario)
- Permission-based operations (complex testing challenge)
- Both API and UI layers (demonstrates hybrid approach)
- You own it (can modify if needed)

---

## WHY

### The Challenge
**Originally planned:**
- 3-4 months preparation time
- Gradual skill building
- Multiple framework iterations

**Reality:**
- Only 1 month available
- Cannot afford 3-4 month career gap
- Must be interview-ready quickly
- Need to stand out despite limited time

### The Problem with Traditional Approach
Most SDET candidates show identical portfolios:
- ❌ Selenium + Page Object Model
- ❌ Data-driven testing from tutorial
- ❌ Basic CI/CD integration
- ❌ "Hello World" level projects

**Result:** No differentiation, hiring manager sees 100 identical candidates

### What Makes You Different
**Not just implementation** → **Architectural thinking**

Instead of: "I wrote Selenium tests"  
**You say:** "I architected a solution to the multi-role testing problem by designing..."

---

## WHEN

### Timeline

**Today:** December 31, 2024  
**Notice Period Ends:** ~January 30, 2025  
**Target:** Ready for interviews by mid-January

### Time Allocation

**Framework Build:** 58-76 focused hours  
**Interview Prep:** Remaining time  
**Contingency:** Buffer for unexpected delays

### Daily Schedule (Proposed)
- 12-15 focused hours/day on framework
- Sprint approach: complete in 5-10 days
- Remaining time: polish, practice, apply to companies

---

## WHERE

### Technical Environment
- **Development:** Local machine (Windows)
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Target Application:** Flow Hub (cloud-hosted)

### Documentation Location
- **Primary:** `d:\personal website\docs\`
- **Backup:** Artifacts directory
- **Version Control:** To be added to Git repo

---

## HOW (High Level)

### Approach
1. ✅ Research what gets SDETs hired at 12 LPA → DONE
2. ✅ Identify real problems worth solving → DONE
3. ✅ Design architecture that solves all problems → DONE
4. ✅ Choose appropriate tech stack → DONE
5. ✅ Document everything → IN PROGRESS
6. ⏳ Build the framework → NEXT
7. ⏳ Practice interview presentation → AFTER BUILD
8. ⏳ Apply to companies → FINAL PHASE

### Success Definition
**Not about:** Perfect code, zero bugs, 100% coverage  
**About:** Demonstrating architectural thinking + problem-solving mindset

**If you can explain WHY you made design decisions, you win.**  
**Even if implementation isn't perfect.**

## Context for New AI Chat

If a new AI is reading this to help:

**Situation:** Developer has 30 days to build impressive automation framework for 12 LPA SDET interviews

**Current Status:** All research and planning complete, ready to start building

**What They Need:** Help implementing the architecture documented in `03_architecture_design.md` following the plan in `05_implementation_plan.md`

**What They Don't Need:** Questioning the decisions already made (problem statement, architecture, tech stack - all finalized)

**Critical:** Time is limited. Focus on execution, not endless planning.
